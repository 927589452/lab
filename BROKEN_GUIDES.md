# Broken Guides

Once we or someone else notices that a guide doesn't work anymore, do the following things:

1. Document that the guide is broken.
    * create an issue stating that the guide is broken. If possible, add details on what exactly is broken.
    * @-mention the original author, notifying them of the broken guide
    * add a banner / warning box to the guide, saying that it might be broken. link the issue.
2. if nobody fixes the guide after 2 months
    * delete the guide
    * add the deleting commit to the issue
    * close the issue
